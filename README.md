# Overview

This weather app was created as a group project for my Web Application Development course. It utilizes VueJS, Firebase, and a [weather api](https://www.weatherapi.com) to display the weather of a location of your choosing.

# Features

- Account Functionality: You can create an account (stored in firebase). With this account you can save favorited locations
- News: You are also able to view recent news articles (work in progress)
